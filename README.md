# Mission to Mars

Using BeautifulSoup, Splinter, Python, HTML, and Bootstrap, I created a web app to show full-resolution images of Mars's hemispheres with titles that were scraped from the [Mars Hemispheres](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) website. First, I scraped the images and titles from the website and stored the data on a Mongo database. Then, I created the web app to show this scraped dataand added Bootstrap components to stylize the app.
